# Assignment 1

**Description**

Open a file in O_APPEND mode, and use the lseek function to move the file pointer to the beginning of the file. This will allow any new data to overwrite the existing content at the start of the file, rather than being added at the end.
As a result, the new data will appear at the beginning of the file.


**Getting Started:**

   ```bash
