# Linux Embedded Training

## Introduction
Welcome to the Linux Embedded Training! This project provides a series of exercises and utilities to help users gain hands-on experience with Linux programming concepts. The exercises cover topics such as thread programming, process management, signal handling, socket communication, file system operations, and more.

Each folder in this project focuses on a specific topic and contains exercises designed to deepen your understanding of Linux programming.

## Folder Overview
Below is an overview of the folders and their respective topics:

### 1. [Thread Programming](./thread)
- Learn how to create, manage, and synchronize threads using the `pthread` library.
- Topics include basic threading, synchronization techniques, thread pools, and real-time processing.

### 2. [Process Programming](./process)
- Explore process creation, execution, and management in Linux.
- Topics include `fork`, `exec`, signal handling, and process status monitoring.

### 3. [Signal Programming](./signal)
- Understand how to handle and generate signals for inter-process communication and asynchronous event handling.
- Topics include catching signals like `SIGINT`, creating timers with `SIGALRM`, and custom signal handling.

### 4. [Socket Programming](./socket)
- Gain experience with network communication using sockets.
- Topics include UNIX domain sockets, Internet domain sockets (TCP and UDP), and client-server communication.

### 5. [Pipe Programming](./pipe)
- Learn how to use unnamed and named pipes (FIFOs) for inter-process communication.
- Topics include parent-child communication, named pipes for unrelated processes, and chaining processes.

### 6. [File System Programming](./file_system)
- Work with Linux file systems to create, read, write, and manage files and directories.
- Topics include file I/O operations, directory management, symbolic links, and file metadata.
